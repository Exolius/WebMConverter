WebMConverter
=============
WebM for retards. Basically, a wrapper around ffmpeg made for converting videos to WebM without having to use the command line.

Latest build is here: http://a.pomf.se/knhowo.zip 

Important to know:
* Requires .NET Framework 4.5
* Only works on Windows (I assume Linux users don't need GUIs)
